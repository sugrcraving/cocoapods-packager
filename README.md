# CocoaPods Packager

## mySugr Ammendments

### Background

With Xcode 12.2 our main project refused to build since it uses a fat binary generated by the CocoaPods Packager (error `Building for iOS Simulator, but the linked and embedded framework was built for iOS + iOS Simulator`). The way out is to use an xcframework instead of the old framework. CocoaPods Packager no longer seems to be maintained and never transitioned the build process to produce xcframework.

For our build process we used the CocoaPods Packager's 1.5.0 release (acafb18). We captured that state in the `release/1.5.0` branch. From there we created another branch called `feature/BCI-260`, referencing the JIRA ticket this fork is referring to.

The adaptions to the build process are minimal, most of the pipeline is untouched. The significant change is to use `xcodebuild` to generate an xcframework instead of `lipo`.

CocoaPods plugin which allows you to generate a framework or static library from a podspec.

This plugin is for CocoaPods *developers*, who need to distribute their Pods not only via CocoaPods, but also as frameworks or static libraries for people who do not use Pods.

## Why should I use Pods if I'm targeting developers who don't use Pods?

There are still a number of advantages to developing against a `podspec`, even if your public distribution is closed-source:

1. You can easily use the Pod in-house in an open-source style. This makes step-by-step debugging and multi-project development a breeze.
2. You can pull in third-party dependencies using CocoaPods. (CocoaPods Packager is even capable of mangling symbols to improve compatibility with any symbols that might appear in the integrating app.)
3. You can declaratively specify build settings (e.g. frameworks, compiler flags) in your `podspec`. This is easier to maintain and replicate than build settings embedded in your Xcode project.

## Installation

```sh
$ gem install cocoapods-packager
```

or add a line to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "cocoapods-packager"
```

then run `bundle install`.

This installs Packager as a CocoaPods plugin.

## Usage

```bash
$ pod package KFData.podspec
```

See also `pod --help`.
